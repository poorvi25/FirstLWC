📄 PROJECT DOCUMENTATION — STUDENT MANAGEMENT APP (Salesforce LWC)

📘 1. Project Overview
Project Name

Student Management System – Salesforce LWC

Project Description

The Student Management System is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC)–based application designed to manage student records efficiently. The application supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides advanced UI features such as search, sorting, pagination, dashboard summaries, and visual analytics using charts.

The project demonstrates real-world Salesforce development practices using Apex, Lightning Web Components, parent-child communication, and Salesforce UI best practices.

🎯 Project Objectives

To create a user-friendly interface for managing student data
To implement real-time UI updates without page refresh
To demonstrate integration of Apex with LWC
To provide dashboard-level insights using summary cards and charts
To follow modular and reusable component design

🧩 2. Application Architecture
High-Level Architecture
StudentApp (Parent Component)
│
├── StudentDashboard (Summary Cards)
├── StudentChart (Pie Chart - Chart.js)
├── StudentForm (Create Student)
└── StudentList (View, Search, Sort, Edit, Delete, Pagination)

Backend

Apex Controller: StudentController
Custom Object: Student__c

⚙️ 3. Technologies Used

Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Apex (Server-side logic)
Salesforce Custom Objects & Fields
Lightning Datatable
Chart.js (via Static Resources)
SLDS (Salesforce Lightning Design System)

🗂️ 4. Component-wise Explanation (Overview)

We will expand each of these in the next step:

Component	Responsibility
StudentApp - Parent container, coordinates child components
StudentForm -	Create new student records
StudentList -	Display students with search, sort, pagination, edit, delete
StudentDashboard - Display total students and class-wise counts
StudentChart - Visual representation of student distribution

🔄 5. Data Flow Summary

User creates a student via StudentForm
StudentForm calls Apex to insert record
StudentForm fires a custom event
Parent component listens to event
Parent triggers refresh on StudentList
StudentList refreshes data using refreshApex
Dashboard and Chart update automatically via @wire

📘 6. Apex Controller – Detailed Explanation
Apex Class Name:
StudentController

Purpose:
Handles all server-side operations for the Student Management App.
Provides reusable methods that are consumed by multiple LWC components.

Apex Methods Used:
1️⃣ getAllStudents()
@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
public static List<Student__c> getAllStudents() {
    return [
        SELECT Id, Name, Email__c, Class__c, Phone__c 
        FROM Student__c
    ];
}


Why it is important:
Used by StudentList, StudentDashboard, and StudentChart
cacheable=true enables:
Better performance
Use with @wire

Manual refresh using refreshApex:

2️⃣ createStudent(Student__c student)
@AuraEnabled
public static Student__c createStudent(Student__c student) {
    insert student;
    return student;
}

Purpose:
Inserts new student records from StudentForm
Returns inserted record for confirmation

3️⃣ updateStudent(Student__c student)
@AuraEnabled
public static void updateStudent(Student__c student) {
    update student;
}


Purpose:
Updates student details from Edit Modal
Used by StudentList

4️⃣ deleteStudent(Id studentId)
@AuraEnabled
public static void deleteStudent(Id studentId) {
    delete [SELECT Id FROM Student__c WHERE Id = :studentId];
}


Purpose:
Deletes student records from the datatable
Triggers UI refresh using refreshApex

✅ Apex Design Highlights
Single controller reused across components
Clean separation of backend and UI
Optimized queries
Supports reactive UI updates
