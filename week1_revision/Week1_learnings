🧠 STEP 1 – Understand Apex (Conceptual)
🩵 What is Apex?

Apex is Salesforce’s programming language, similar to Java.

It runs on the Salesforce platform, used for business logic, automation, and database operations.

Think of Apex as the “brain” behind your Salesforce components — when buttons are clicked, records updated, or logic applied, Apex defines what happens.

⚙️ Where Apex Fits in Salesforce:
Layer	Description
UI Layer (Front-end)	Lightning pages, Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Server-side Logic (Backend)	Apex classes, triggers
Database Layer	Salesforce Objects (Accounts, Contacts, etc.)

When you use Apex, you’re writing backend logic that manipulates data stored in Salesforce objects.

🧩 Apex Class = A Logical Container

An Apex Class groups related methods (functions) together.

Example analogy:

A “Remote Control” class has functions: turnOn(), turnOff(), increaseVolume()
Similarly, an “AccountUtility” class can have: getAccounts(), createAccount(), deleteAccount()
