🧠 STEP 1 – Understand Apex (Conceptual)
🩵 What is Apex?

Apex is Salesforce’s programming language, similar to Java.

It runs on the Salesforce platform, used for business logic, automation, and database operations.

Think of Apex as the “brain” behind your Salesforce components — when buttons are clicked, records updated, or logic applied, Apex defines what happens.

⚙️ Where Apex Fits in Salesforce:
Layer	Description
UI Layer (Front-end)	Lightning pages, Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Server-side Logic (Backend)	Apex classes, triggers
Database Layer	Salesforce Objects (Accounts, Contacts, etc.)

When you use Apex, you’re writing backend logic that manipulates data stored in Salesforce objects.

🧩 Apex Class = A Logical Container

An Apex Class groups related methods (functions) together.

Example analogy:

A “Remote Control” class has functions: turnOn(), turnOff(), increaseVolume()
Similarly, an “AccountUtility” class can have: getAccounts(), createAccount(), deleteAccount()


⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)


🎯 Goal: Understand what an Apex Trigger is, when and how it runs, and deploy your first trigger in VS Code.

🧠 STEP 1 – Understand What a Trigger Is
💡 Definition

An Apex Trigger is a piece of code that automatically executes when a data event occurs (insert, update, delete, etc.) on a Salesforce Object.

Think of it as:

“When something happens to a record → do this additional logic.”

🧩 STEP 2 – Why We Use Triggers
Use Case	Example
Auto-populate a field	Set “Description” whenever an Account is created
Validate data before saving	Stop insert if a field is blank
Update related records	When an Opportunity closes, update Account status
Create child records	When a new Account is inserted, create a default Contact

⚠️ Triggers run before or after database operations (DML).

⚙️ STEP 3 – Trigger Context & Events
Event	When It Runs	Typical Use
before insert	Before record is saved	Modify fields or validate data
after insert	After record is saved	Create related records
before update	Before existing record is updated	Validate changes
after update	After record is updated	Trigger further actions
before/after delete	When record is deleted	Clean up related data⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)

⚡ WEEK 1 → DAY 3 (LWC Fundamentals + Hands-on “Hello World”)

🎯 Goal: Understand what LWC is, how it fits into Salesforce, and build your first component end-to-end in VS Code.

🧠 STEP 1 – What is LWC

Lightning Web Components (LWC) = Salesforce’s modern front-end framework built on standard JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It lets you create fast, reusable UI components that talk to Salesforce data using Apex or built-in wire adapters.

Think of LWC as the “visual face” of your Apex logic.

⚙️ STEP 2 – Why LWC (Compared to Aura)
Feature	LWC	Aura
Based on Modern Web Standards	✅ Yes	❌ Older Framework
Speed & Performance	⚡ Fast (JavaScript Engine)	🐢 Slower
Developer Experience	VS Code + Modules	XML heavy
Recommended by Salesforce (2025 onward)	✅ Yes	⚠️ Legacy

So → always build new UIs using LWC.

🧩 STEP 3 – LWC File Structure

When you create an LWC component, Salesforce generates three main files:

File	Purpose
helloWorld.html	Template (UI structure)
helloWorld.js	JavaScript logic (variables, events)
helloWorld.js-meta.xml	Metadata file (defines where component can appear — Record Page, App, etc.)
