🧠 STEP 1 – Understand Apex (Conceptual)
🩵 What is Apex?

Apex is Salesforce’s programming language, similar to Java.

It runs on the Salesforce platform, used for business logic, automation, and database operations.

Think of Apex as the “brain” behind your Salesforce components — when buttons are clicked, records updated, or logic applied, Apex defines what happens.

⚙️ Where Apex Fits in Salesforce:
Layer	Description
UI Layer (Front-end)	Lightning pages, Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Server-side Logic (Backend)	Apex classes, triggers
Database Layer	Salesforce Objects (Accounts, Contacts, etc.)

When you use Apex, you’re writing backend logic that manipulates data stored in Salesforce objects.

🧩 Apex Class = A Logical Container

An Apex Class groups related methods (functions) together.

Example analogy:

A “Remote Control” class has functions: turnOn(), turnOff(), increaseVolume()
Similarly, an “AccountUtility” class can have: getAccounts(), createAccount(), deleteAccount()


⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)

📅 Date: Oct 30
🎯 Goal: Understand what an Apex Trigger is, when and how it runs, and deploy your first trigger in VS Code.

🧠 STEP 1 – Understand What a Trigger Is
💡 Definition

An Apex Trigger is a piece of code that automatically executes when a data event occurs (insert, update, delete, etc.) on a Salesforce Object.

Think of it as:

“When something happens to a record → do this additional logic.”

🧩 STEP 2 – Why We Use Triggers
Use Case	Example
Auto-populate a field	Set “Description” whenever an Account is created
Validate data before saving	Stop insert if a field is blank
Update related records	When an Opportunity closes, update Account status
Create child records	When a new Account is inserted, create a default Contact

⚠️ Triggers run before or after database operations (DML).

⚙️ STEP 3 – Trigger Context & Events
Event	When It Runs	Typical Use
before insert	Before record is saved	Modify fields or validate data
after insert	After record is saved	Create related records
before update	Before existing record is updated	Validate changes
after update	After record is updated	Trigger further actions
before/after delete	When record is deleted	Clean up related data⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)
