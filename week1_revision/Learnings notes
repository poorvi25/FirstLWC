🧠 STEP 1 – Understand Apex (Conceptual)
🩵 What is Apex?

Apex is Salesforce’s programming language, similar to Java.

It runs on the Salesforce platform, used for business logic, automation, and database operations.

Think of Apex as the “brain” behind your Salesforce components — when buttons are clicked, records updated, or logic applied, Apex defines what happens.

⚙️ Where Apex Fits in Salesforce:
Layer	Description
UI Layer (Front-end)	Lightning pages, Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Server-side Logic (Backend)	Apex classes, triggers
Database Layer	Salesforce Objects (Accounts, Contacts, etc.)

When you use Apex, you’re writing backend logic that manipulates data stored in Salesforce objects.

🧩 Apex Class = A Logical Container

An Apex Class groups related methods (functions) together.

Example analogy:

A “Remote Control” class has functions: turnOn(), turnOff(), increaseVolume()
Similarly, an “AccountUtility” class can have: getAccounts(), createAccount(), deleteAccount()


⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)


🎯 Goal: Understand what an Apex Trigger is, when and how it runs, and deploy your first trigger in VS Code.

🧠 STEP 1 – Understand What a Trigger Is
💡 Definition

An Apex Trigger is a piece of code that automatically executes when a data event occurs (insert, update, delete, etc.) on a Salesforce Object.

Think of it as:

“When something happens to a record → do this additional logic.”

🧩 STEP 2 – Why We Use Triggers
Use Case	Example
Auto-populate a field	Set “Description” whenever an Account is created
Validate data before saving	Stop insert if a field is blank
Update related records	When an Opportunity closes, update Account status
Create child records	When a new Account is inserted, create a default Contact

⚠️ Triggers run before or after database operations (DML).

⚙️ STEP 3 – Trigger Context & Events
Event	When It Runs	Typical Use
before insert	Before record is saved	Modify fields or validate data
after insert	After record is saved	Create related records
before update	Before existing record is updated	Validate changes
after update	After record is updated	Trigger further actions
before/after delete	When record is deleted	Clean up related data⚙️ WEEK 1 → DAY 2 (Apex Trigger Fundamentals + Hands-on)

⚡ WEEK 1 → DAY 3 (LWC Fundamentals + Hands-on “Hello World”)

🎯 Goal: Understand what LWC is, how it fits into Salesforce, and build your first component end-to-end in VS Code.

🧠 STEP 1 – What is LWC

Lightning Web Components (LWC) = Salesforce’s modern front-end framework built on standard JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It lets you create fast, reusable UI components that talk to Salesforce data using Apex or built-in wire adapters.

Think of LWC as the “visual face” of your Apex logic.

⚙️ STEP 2 – Why LWC (Compared to Aura)
Feature	LWC	Aura
Based on Modern Web Standards	✅ Yes	❌ Older Framework
Speed & Performance	⚡ Fast (JavaScript Engine)	🐢 Slower
Developer Experience	VS Code + Modules	XML heavy
Recommended by Salesforce (2025 onward)	✅ Yes	⚠️ Legacy

So → always build new UIs using LWC.

🧩 STEP 3 – LWC File Structure

When you create an LWC component, Salesforce generates three main files:

File	Purpose
helloWorld.html	Template (UI structure)
helloWorld.js	JavaScript logic (variables, events)
helloWorld.js-meta.xml	Metadata file (defines where component can appear — Record Page, App, etc.)

Summary of How It Works Internally

- Salesforce injects recordId into your component when it’s placed on a record page.

- LWC detects that recordId changed.

- Because you prefixed $recordId ($ - reactive variable) in your @wire parameters → the wire function re-runs automatically.

- getRecord fetches new data → updates the bound variable (this.record).

- UI updates automatically.

Example Quiz (interview tip)

🧩 Question: What happens if you remove $ from $recordId inside your @wire decorator?
Answer: The record ID becomes static; @wire will not re-run when the record changes, and the component won’t refresh on navigation.


SOSL & SOQL:

| Type     | Full Form                         | Purpose                                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SOQL** | Salesforce Object Query Language  | Fetch records from **one object (and its relationships)** |
| **SOSL** | Salesforce Object Search Language | Search a text term across **multiple objects** at once    |

| Scenario                             | Use SOQL | Use SOSL |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| Need data from one object            | ✅        | ❌        |
| Need to filter on field values       | ✅        | ❌        |
| Need to search text across objects   | ❌        | ✅        |
| Searching a keyword typed by user    | ❌        | ✅        |
| Display related records in LWC table | ✅        | ❌        |

🧠 STEP 1 – Understand What “Imperative Apex Call” Means

In @wire, Salesforce handles the call automatically.

In an imperative call, you decide when to call Apex — usually after a button click or user input.

This gives you more control (great for search, filters, save/update operations).

Think:

“When the user clicks Search → fetch data from Apex manually.”

🔹 Pagination

When there are many records, you don’t want to fetch all 1000 at once.
Instead, you fetch e.g. 10 records → show → click Next → fetch next 10.

🔹 Sorting

Lightning Datatable lets you click a column header to reorder data by that field (ascending or descending).
You’ll control that logic in JavaScript.

Database.query(fullQuery)
Dynamic SOQL
Executes query built as a string

💡 What is @track in LWC?

In LWC, @track is used to make a variable reactive — meaning if that variable’s value changes, the UI automatically updates to reflect the new data.

Think of it like telling LWC:

“Hey Salesforce, keep an eye on this variable — if it changes, re-render the template.”

If we wont use any decorator what happens-

| Data Type | Without Decorator                   | With `@track` | Behavior                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `String`  | ✅ Reactive                          | ✅ Reactive    | Works either way                                                   |
| `Number`  | ✅ Reactive                          | ✅ Reactive    | Works either way                                                   |
| `Boolean` | ✅ Reactive                          | ✅ Reactive    | Works either way                                                   |
| `Array`   | ⚠️ Not reactive on internal changes | ✅ Reactive    | Add/remove elements won’t re-render unless reassigned              |
| `Object`  | ⚠️ Not reactive on internal changes | ✅ Reactive    | Inner property changes won’t reflect unless `@track` or reassigned |
------------------------------
ALL KINDS OF DECORATOR IN LWC-
| Decorator | Meaning                                          | Used For                        | Reactivity                           | Example                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `@track`  | Make property reactive (esp. for objects/arrays) | Internal variables              | ✅ UI auto-updates when value changes | `@track user = { name: 'Poorvi' };` |
| `@api`    | Make property/method public                      | Parent → Child communication    | ⚙️ Controlled by parent              | `@api message;`                     |
| `@wire`   | Wire Apex or Salesforce data                     | Auto-fetching data from backend | ✅ Auto-updates when param changes    | `@wire(getAccounts) accounts;`      |

| Situation                     | What to Use                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Simple string/number          | Nothing                     |
| List of records               | `@track` or reassign array  |
| Object with nested fields     | `@track` or reassign object |
| Data shared with parent       | `@api`                      |
| Data fetched from Apex or LDS | `@wire`                     |

🌍 What Is NavigationMixin in LWC?

The NavigationMixin is a Salesforce-provided JavaScript mixin that allows your Lightning Web Component to navigate the user to different pages —
just like clicking a link or button in the Salesforce UI.

Think of it as:

“A built-in helper that lets my LWC open other pages inside Salesforce Lightning Experience — record pages, list views, URLs, files, etc.”

⚙️ Why We Need It

Normally, JavaScript in a browser can’t directly control Salesforce’s internal navigation (record pages, setup pages, etc.),
because those routes are handled inside the Lightning framework — not normal URLs.
import { NavigationMixin } from 'lightning/navigation';

export default class AccountSearch extends NavigationMixin(LightningElement) {

this[NavigationMixin.Navigate](pageReference);

🧠 What Is a Page Reference?

A Page Reference is simply a JavaScript object that describes what and where you want to navigate.

{
  type: 'standard__recordPage',
  attributes: {
    recordId: '001xxxxxxxxxxxx',
    objectApiName: 'Account',
    actionName: 'view'
  }
}
| Key             | Meaning                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`          | What kind of page to open (record page, list view, URL, etc.) |
| `recordId`      | The Salesforce record ID                                      |
| `objectApiName` | Object name (`Account`, `Contact`, etc.)                      |
| `actionName`    | What to do — `view`, `edit`, or `clone`                       |
-----------------------------------------------
⭐ What does dispatchEvent() do? (Layman's Explanation)

Think of it like this:

👉 A child LWC wants to tell the parent LWC that something happened

So the child sends a signal/message.

That signal is the Custom Event.

dispatchEvent() allows a child LWC to notify the parent that something happened (like button clicked, record created, etc).
⭐ Real World Analogy

👍 Child = ringing a doorbell
👍 dispatchEvent = pressing the bell button
👍 Parent = hears the ring and responds
